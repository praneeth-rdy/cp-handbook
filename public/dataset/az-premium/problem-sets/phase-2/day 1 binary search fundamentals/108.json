We take mid = (L+R)/2.</p><p>If A[L] \u2264 A[mid], that means the array is sorted from L to mid, mid+1 could be a possible answer and then we continue binary search from L = mid+1 to R. Otherwise, A[L] &gt; A[mid], that means the minimum number would be somewhere between L to mid, because if the array is not increasing in this range there will be an inflection point where the element is smaller than the element before it, so we continue binary search from L to R = mid.</p><p>Time Complexity per test case: O(N + log<sub>2</sub>N) (since we are performing binary search on the length of the given array)</p>"
