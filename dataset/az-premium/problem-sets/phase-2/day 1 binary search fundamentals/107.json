This would be done by binary search, since the peak point would be the only point that is greater than elements to both sides, its left and right. We take the left pointer L = 1, the right pointer R = N (since the array is 1-indexed) and mid = (L+R)/2. If we get A[mid-1] &lt; A[mid], that means mid could be a possible peak, since the peak cannot exist at any point lower than mid, so we continue binary search on L = mid+1 to R. Otherwise, A[mid-1] &gt; A[mid], the peak would be lower than mid, so we continue binary search on L to R = mid-1. If peak is the index of the given query number, that would be the answer.</p><p>After finding the peak, we apply binary search on both sides of the peak, i.e. from L = 1 to R = peak -1 and L = peak + 1 to R = N, separately. Note that it is possible that an element can exist in the left part as well as the right part of the peak of the array.</p><p>Time Complexity per test case: O(Q log<sub>2</sub>N) (since we are performing binary search on the length of the given array)</p>"
