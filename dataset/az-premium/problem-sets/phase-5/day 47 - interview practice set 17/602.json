So the next character in $Z$ must be equal to $Y[j]$.  \n   - If it is equal, we go to $dp[n][j+1]$.  \n   - If it is not equal, we return $0$.\n\n3. $i \\neq n$ and $j == m$:  \n   String $Y$ has been used up. So the next character in $Z$ must be equal to $X[i]$.  \n   - If it is equal, we go to $dp[i+1][m]$.  \n   - If it is not equal, we return $0$.\n\n### Transitions:\n1. If $X[i] == Z[i+j]$, we use the $i$-th index of $X$ and go to $dp[i+1][j]$.  \n2. If $Y[j] == Z[i+j]$, we use the $j$-th index of $Y$ and go to $dp[i][j+1]$.\n\nIf in any case we get $1$, then $dp[i][j] = 1$.  \nOtherwise, $dp[i][j] = 0$.\n\nSo, if the string $Z$ is an interleaving of $X$ and $Y$, $dp[0][0] = 1$.\n\n### Time Complexity:\nThe overall time complexity is $O(n \\cdot m)$.\n"
